# About
I help founders and teams close cleaner deals, faster—without hidden risk—by combining contract expertise with lightweight AI tooling.

## What I do
- Contract review & redlines
- Negotiation playbooks (goal + fallback language)
- Deal desk support and routing
- AI-assisted analyzers, risk registers, and dashboards

## How I work
1. **Clarity first.** Context, risk posture, deadlines.
2. **Fast drafts.** Tight loops on what matters.
3. **Measurable outcomes.** Cycle time, blockers cleared, risk deltas.

## Principles
- Pragmatic, business-first
- Human-in-the-loop for anything sensitive
- Clear next steps, always

# Dashboards & Calculators

Planned interactive sheets and embeds:
- **Design of Experiments (DoE):** choose factors, levels, and response; auto-generate runs.
- **Deal Desk Calculator:** margin/discount guardrails and SLA cost.
- **GTM Funnel Planner:** targets, CPL/CAC, payback.
- **Risk Register:** clause IDs, severity, owner, due dates.

_(Embeds and CSV downloads will be added in a later step.)_
